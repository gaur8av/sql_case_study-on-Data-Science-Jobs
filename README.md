### üìä Task 6 to 19:

*Many of these were not included in the original SQL file. For these, queries were designed based on the business problem provided in the `.docx` file.*

If you'd like, I can help extract **exact queries from your `task_solution.sql`** file (wherever applicable) and match them line-by-line with the refactored ones above in the README.
