This project involves comprehensive SQL-based analysis of global data science job trends. From salary growth to remote work shifts, the project answers real-world business questions faced by recruiters, analysts, consultants, and HR professionals.

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze various trends in data science jobs including:
- Salary insights by country, experience level, and job title
- Remote work trends from 2021 to 2024
- Entry-level and part-time job market dynamics
- Domain switch guidance for professionals based on salary data
- Growth patterns across countries and job types

## 🗃️ Dataset

The dataset simulates real-world employee/job-related information and includes attributes like:
- Job Title
- Salary in USD
- Company Size
- Company Location
- Experience Level
- Remote Ratio
- Employment Type
